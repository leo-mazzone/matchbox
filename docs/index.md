Record matching is a chore. Matchbox is a match pipeline orchestration tool that aims to:

* Make matching an iterative, collaborative, measurable problem
* Allow organisations to know they have matching records without having to share the data
* Allow matching pipelines to run iteratively
* Support batch and real-time matching 

Matchbox doesn't store raw data, instead indexing the data in your warehouse and leaving permissioning at the level of the user, service or pipeline.

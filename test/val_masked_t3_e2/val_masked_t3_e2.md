# val_maskedg_t3_e2

A masked match with three tables and two entities, contradicted by an entry in the 
validation table.

Note the probabilities table is identical to masked_t3_e2. Only the validate table 
changes.

If you accept that the masked_t3_e2 test output is correct, you van verify this test by 
checking the validate table successfully overrides the clusters output.
